# What This Is About
This repository contains the source code for my personal website.
It’s a focused, fast, and intentionally built space on the internet —
where I present my work, thinking, and long-term projects.

# Philosophy
I believe software should be:
Clear over clever
Fast over flashy
Durable over trendy
Simple at the surface, powerful underneath

This site reflects how I build products:
small surface area, strong foundations.

# What This Site Represents

Projects I’ve built
Systems I’ve designed
Ideas I’m exploring
Problems I care about solving
It evolves as I do.

# Architecture

Built with a modern, performance-first stack.
## Core principles:

Component-driven architecture
Type safety where it matters
Minimal dependencies
SEO and accessibility by default
Clean separation of concerns

Everything is structured for maintainability and long-term iteration.

## Local Development
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
npm install
npm run dev

# Performance:

Optimized asset loading
Static generation where possible
Measured, not assumed
Lighthouse-conscious
Speed is a feature.

This project is intentionally lean, but continuously refined.

# Planned improvements:

Deeper technical case studies
Writing section for long-form thinking
Experiments lab
Infrastructure transparency page
Analytics with privacy in mind

# Why Open Source?
Because I respect builders who share.

You’re welcome to explore the structure and ideas.
If something here helps you build better, that’s a win.
